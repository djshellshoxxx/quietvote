## `qv election spoil-collect` (coordinator, offline)

```
qv election spoil-collect --election <bundle> --code <64-hex> --packet <file> [--packet <file>]... [--manifest-hash <hex>] [--post-body-out <dir>] [--json]
```

Combines the `spoil-share` packets produced by `qv-trustee spoil-release` for one trustees-mode spoiled ballot and prints the decoded
selections. Exit 0 on success, 1 if the code is not a verified trustees-mode spoil (unknown, cast, re-wrapped) or fewer than `t`
shares verify, 2 usage, 4 unreadable input. `--post-body-out` writes each verified record as `<dir>/<code8>-<j>.json` (the signed
record, the request body to POST to the coordinator's spoil-shares endpoint, e.g. with `curl --data-binary @file`).
